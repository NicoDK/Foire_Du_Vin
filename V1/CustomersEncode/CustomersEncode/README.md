This first version will allow importing data from an Excel file containing the customers of the Aywaille Wine Fair.

Moreover:
- We can search for a customer by last name, first name and email;
- We can encode new customers in another file with new customers;
- We can encode customers to add them to the raffle in a new excel file;
- You can encode an existing client to edit it in a new excel file;

These Excel files will be stored in the path: “C:/FoireDuVin2024/”.
