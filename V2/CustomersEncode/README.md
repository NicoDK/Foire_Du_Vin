This second version will allow importing data from an Excel file containing the customers of the Aywaille Wine Fair.

Update of the first version:
- You must import an excel file before adding a new customer. Like this, this one can be added to the excel file directly ;
- Two types of file will be stored to the path “C:/FoireDuVin2024/”, and it is the raffle ;
- The edit technology is going to update the customer in the imported file (NOT DONE!)
